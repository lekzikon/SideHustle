                <li><b>1956</b> Along with 155 others, Mandela is accused of conspiring to overthrow the South African state by violent means and is charged with treason. After a four-year trial, the charges are dropped.</li>
                <li><b>1960 March 21</b> People in Sharpeville protest against restrictions on their freedom of movement. Police kill 69 people, including women and children, and a state of emergency is declared amid fears of retaliation. Later the same month, the ANC is banned, a state of emergency is imposed and Mandela is detained.</li>
                <li><b>1963 August 7</b> The Security Council adopted Resolution 181 calling upon all states to cease the sale and shipment of arms, ammunition and military vehicles to South Africa. The arms embargo was made mandatory on November 4 1977</li>

                <li><b>1985</b> In January, President PW Botha offers Mandela conditional release from prison, which Mandela refuses. Later that year, Mandela initiates talks with the apartheid regime when he writes to Kobie Coetsee, minister of justice</li>
                <li><b>1990 February 11</b> Mandela is released from prison, greeted by large crowds. That year, negotiations begin about the formation of a multiracial democracy in South Africa.</li>
                <li><b>1993</b> Mandela, along with South African president FW de Klerk, is jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for efforts to bring stability to South Africa.
